                  <li>It is best practice for screening to be conducted verbally. However, if your hospital administers
                    the screen by paper, you can introduce it the same way.</li>
                  <li>Maintain confidentiality to the best of your ability. Ideally, the screen takes place privately
                    without family members in the room.</li>

                    years postpartum.</li>

                  once in the third trimester, at the six-week postpartum visit and annually at well women exams. It is
                  also recommended that screening take place in the pediatrician's office at the babyâ€™s 3, 6 and 12
                  month well child visits and in the primary care office.</p>

                  display information about perinatal mental health, thus educating and creating awareness about this
                  important issue for every patient and their support person(s). It is important that screening is done
                  with an inclusive, strength-based approach that emphasizes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Perinatal mental health conditions are common.</li>
                  <li>They are medical conditions, like diabetes, that need to be treated.</li>
                  <li>They are treatable.</li>
                  <li>That the hospital screens every woman after childbirth and before discharge.</li>
                  <li>The hospital cares for the whole woman.</li>

                  check-in on how you have been doing to gather as much information as possible in order to best treat
                  you. These questions are standard practice that are asked of every patient, but some of them can be a
                  bit uncomfortable to answer. </p>
                <p>It is not uncommon for women to have difficult emotions during pregnancy or after childbirth, and if
                  you find that any of these questions resonate with you just know that you are not alone. Having a new
                  baby is a big adjustment for anyone.</p>
