                  <li>It is best practice for screening to be conducted verbally.  However, if your hospital administers the screen by paper, you can introduce it the same way.</li>
                  <li>Maintain confidentiality to the best of your ability. Ideally, the screen takes place privately without family members in the room.</li>
                  <li>Remain non-judgmental and neutral while completing screening tool.</li>

                      <li>Universal screening practices normalize conversations about emotional wellness.</li>
                      <li>Screening tools are not a replacement for clinical judgment.</li>

                  <p>ACOG recommends mental health screening take place in the hospital post-delivery before discharge home, in addition to the following: the first prenatal visit, at least once in the second trimester, once in the third trimester, at the six-week postpartum visit and annually at well women exams.  It is also recommended that screening take place in the pediatrician's office at the babyâ€™s 3, 6 and 12 month well child visits and in the primary care office.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>To facilitate screening, hospitals need to create welcoming and non-stigmatizing environments that display information about perinatal mental health, thus educating and creating awareness about this important issue for every patient and their support person(s).  It is important that screening is done with an inclusive, strength-based approach that emphasizes:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Perinatal mental health conditions are common.</li>
                    <li>They are medical conditions, like diabetes, that need to be treated.</li>
                    <li>They are treatable.</li>
                    <li>That the hospital screens every woman after childbirth and before discharge.</li>
                    <li>The hospital cares for the whole woman.</li>
                  </ul>

                <div>
